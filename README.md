## Description
A data analysis project from my final year of university at the Univeristy of Nottingham, Computer Science. 

### What it does
This project delves into the world of professional golf through a comprehensive analysis of PGA tour data spanning the 2015-2022 seasons. Leveraging R programming, the analysis focuses on key performance indicators, strokes gained metrics, and various facets of player success in elite-level tournaments.


### Project Objectives
- Understand Player Performance: Explore and understand the performance of players on the PGA tour, unraveling insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

- Evaluate Strokes Gained: Assess the effectiveness of the widely-used strokes gained metric as a measure of player performance and its correlation with finishing positions.

- Impact of Purse Size: Investigate the relationship between tournament purse sizes and player performance, uncovering patterns in higher-stake tournaments.

- Seasonal Trends: Identify trends in player scoring across seasons, shedding light on variations in performance over the years.

- Scoring Categories: Analyze the proportion of players scoring under par, even par, and over par, providing a holistic view of scoring trends.


### Key Findings
- Strokes Gained Validity: Strokes gained proves to be a reliable metric for evaluating player performance, with a clear correlation with finishing positions.

- Purse Size Impact: Higher purse sizes do not necessarily translate to better player performance, with a notable drop in results in the highest-stake tournaments.

- Seasonal Variations: Seasons exhibit different player scoring trends, with variations in average scores and notable performance disparities.

- Scoring Categories Overview: The proportion of players scoring under par, even par, and over par provides a comprehensive snapshot of player performance trends.

- Importance of "Tee to Green": For tournament champions, the most critical aspect contributing to strokes gained is the "tee to green" performance.
